## Torsional Pendulum 
* Moment of Inertia - It is body's tendency to resist angular acceleration, Mathematically is sum of Mass of each particle in the body wiht the square of its distance from axis of rotation. 
* Torque - It is force which that can cause rotational accleration, It is analogus to Force in linear kinemtics. 
* Torsion - It is twisting deformation caused in a material due to an torque. 
* Torsional Pendulum - It is experimental setup where a rigid body is suspended by a wire to made to and fro motion, using wire as axis of rotation.

## Torsional Pendulum 
* Moment of Inertia - It is body's tendency to resist angular acceleration, Mathematically is sum of Mass of each particle in the body wiht the square of its distance from axis of rotation. 
* Torque - It is force which that can cause rotational accleration, It is analogus to Force in linear kinemtics. 
* Torsion - It is twisting deformation caused in a material due to an torque. 
* Torsional Pendulum - It is experimental setup where a rigid body is suspended by a wire to made to and fro motion, using wire as axis of rotation. 
* Why amplittude is ketp small - Althoug in ideal case of SHM time period does not depend on Amplitude but as the amplitude increases the disc loses the property of SHM. 
* Hooks law - Strain is directly proportional to strian within elastic limit. 
* Elasticity is direclty prop to Impurity and iversely to temp
* Elastic limit -  It is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand before the permanent deformation, after it Hook law is not applicable and material get permanent deformation. 
* Elastic Fatigue - If any elastic substance is kept on a streched postion for very long time, it will not attain it's original shape once the force is withdrawn. 
* Elsatic after effect = Substance take time to regain it's original shape from its streched postion. it very low Phoshphorus bronze spring. 
* Poisson ratio - Ratio of lateral strain and longitudnal strain  (Generally ranges from -1 to 0.5) 
* Youngs Modulus - Ratio of Normal Stress and longitudnal strain
* Bulk Modulus - Ratio of normal stress to volumetric strain 
* Modulus of rigidity - Ratio of shear stress and shear strain 
* Uses of Torsional pendulum - 
  1. Modulus of rgidity of wire 
  2. Periodic motion can be used to design Torsional Clock 
  3. Force tors pendul inserted in a dense liquid helps to determine viscousity and frictional force. 

## Flywheel 
* Inertia - Property of matter by the virtue of which it resists any change to it's state of motion or rest. 
* Radius of Gyration - defined as a point which could have same MOI as of actual body if total mass of body is concentrated on it. 
* MOI is min when axis of rotation passes through centre of mass
* KE of flywheel is 1/2*I*omega^2
* Flywheel - large wheel which has mass mostly concentrated on its rim they are attahced on axels of moving part of machines. 
* Flywheel are used to maintain a steady motion by absorbing energy when machine tend to run faster and supplying energy when machine tend to slow down. 

## Bar pendulum
* Simple pendulum - single islated particle suspended using a weightless and inextensible string on a friction less suppport. Time period is 2 pi root l by g
* Periodic Motion - That repeats after some time like motion of sun moon motion of a steady wheel etc. 
* Harmonic motion- particle oscillates symmetrically about the mean position like string of guitar.
* SHM - when restoring force is proportional to negative of it;s displacement from mean pos 
* Diff b/w simple and compound pendulum - in simple centre of gravity and oscillation are same. In compound Centre of gravity and oscillation are different. 
* Amplitude is kept small to minimize mechanical and resistive losses. 
* The value of g is greater at poles and less at equator 

## Katers 
* Importance/Uses - In earlier days it is used to find accurate value of g and hence accurate value of time. But in todays world it only used for demonstration purposes. 
* Reversible - because two knife edges and two adjustable masses are positioned on the so that time period of swing is almost same for both edge. 


## Spirng Constant
* Elasticity - The propery of an material b virtue of which it tends to regain it'soriginal form.
* Spring const - force required to produce unit extension in a spring. 
* Thick wire has lower spring const and it decreases with length and increases with curl density. 
* Time period - 2 pi root m by k

## Torsional Pendulum 
* Moment of Inertia - It is body's tendency to resist angular acceleration, Mathematically is sum of Mass of each particle in the body wiht the square of its distance from axis of rotation. 
* Torque - It is force which that can cause rotational accleration, It is analogus to Force in linear kinemtics. 
* Torsion - It is twisting deformation caused in a material due to an torque. 
* Torsional Pendulum - It is experimental setup where a rigid body is suspended by a wire to made to and fro motion, using wire as axis of rotation. 
* Why amplittude is ketp small - Althoug in ideal case of SHM time period does not depend on Amplitude but as the amplitude increases the disc loses the property of SHM. 
* Hooks law - Strain is directly proportional to strian within elastic limit. 
* Elastic limit -  It is defined as the maximum stress that a material can withstand before the permanent deformation, after it Hook law is not applicable and material get permanent deformation. 
* Poisson ratio - Ratio of lateral strain and longitudnal strain  (Generally ranges from -1 to 0.5) 
* Youngs Modulus - Ratio of Normal Stress and longitudnal strain
* Bulk Modulus - Ratio of normal stress to volumetric strain 
* Modulus of rigidity - Ratio of shear stress and shear strain 
* Uses of Torsional pendulum - 
  1. Modulus of rgidity of wire 
  2. Periodic motion can be used to design Torsional Clock 
  3. Force tors pendul inserted in a dense liquid helps to determine viscousity and frictional force.
